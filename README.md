### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I am ***Emmanuel Oluwagbemiga Adebiyi (Smart)***

I build desktop, web and mobile applications. I also build Machine Learning models and really love Computer Vision scenarios.

I develop majorly with the languages/frameworks below:

* ASP.NET Core (C#)
* React.js
* Xamarin.Forms (C#)
* Android (Java)
* WinUI (C#)
* WPF and WinForms (C#)
* PyTorch
* ML.NET

You're probably guessed by now. I really love .NET, however I use and love other technologies as well

I love building enabling tools for developers (Contact me if you've got something for me).
