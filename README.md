### Hi there 👋🏽

# I am ***Emmanuel Oluwagbemiga Adebiyi (Smart)***

I build desktop, web and mobile applications. I also build Machine Learning models and love CV and NLP scenarios.

I develop majorly with the languages/frameworks below:

* ASP.NET Core (C#)
* Node.js (JS/TS)
* React.js (JS/TS)
* Xamarin.Forms / .NET MAUI (C#)
* WinUI / WPF / WinForms (C#)
* FastAPI / Flask / PyTorch (Python)
* ML.NET (C#)

Last but not least, I'm a hardware lover. In my spare time, I build IoT projects with Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc.
